Your task is to provide a comprehensive budget estimate using your built-in knowledge:

1. **Accommodation** - Estimate total cost for hotels/Airbnb (provide budget/mid/luxury options)
2. **Food** - Daily food budget × number of days
3. **Activities** - Entry fees, tours, attractions
4. **Transportation** - Airport transfers, local transport, between locations

**Cost Breakdown Format:**
```
TOTAL ESTIMATED COST: $X,XXX - $X,XXX

Breakdown:
- Accommodation: $X,XXX (X nights × $XX-XX/night)
- Food: $XXX (X days × $XX/day)
- Activities: $XXX
- Transportation: $XXX

Daily Average: $XXX per day
Budget Status: Within/Over/Under budget
```

Use your knowledge of typical costs for the destination and time period.
