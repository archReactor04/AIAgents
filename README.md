## 🎓 What I've Learned So Far

### Key Insights

1. **Simplicity Wins:** Started with complex LangGraph, switched to simpler Swarm - much better results
2. **Agent Specialization:** Single-purpose agents are easier to debug and maintain
3. **UI Matters:** Even the best agents are useless with a broken UI (learned the hard way!)
4. **Iteration is Key:** First version is never perfect - test, debug, refine
5. **Cost Awareness:** Monitor API usage - agents can make many calls quickly

### Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution | Learning |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Buttons not working in Streamlit | Use `st.session_state` properly | State management is critical |
| Slow generation (90+ seconds) | Optimize prompts, remove unnecessary calls | Performance requires planning |
| Empty sections in output | Better prompt engineering, structured output | LLMs need clear instructions |
| Complex orchestration | Switch from LangGraph to Swarm | Choose tools that fit the problem |
